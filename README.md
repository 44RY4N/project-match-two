# project-match-two

The following project uses HTML,CSS and js to implement the game Match Two

---(its a famous game and this was a personal project, I had to practice grid and I wanted to make something interactive where I could learn as many features as I could)

- Implemented using simple JS DOM manipulation please refer to my script.js file
- CSS involved uses keyframes to simulate animations for the home menu
- HTML is kept very basic for efficiency
- Added features like difficulty selection and spam protection to maintain the integrity
- Also added delays wherever required for better UX
