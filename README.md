- **CSS3**: 3D animations, responsive design, Grid Layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic, DOM manipulation, click spam protection
- **No frameworks**: Pure vanilla magic ✨

## 🔍 Features

- 🎮 Click-to-flip memory cards
- 🧠 Match two logic with feedback animations
- 🔐 Board locking during animations to prevent spam
- ✨ CSS Grid layout for card positioning
- 💫 Smooth transitions and effects
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## 🚧 How It Works

1. On load, cards are shuffled and hidden.
2. Click to flip a card — flip a second to check for match.
3. Matching cards stay flipped, others flip back.
4. Game ends when all pairs are matched.

# project-match-two

The following project uses HTML,CSS and js to implement the game Match Two

---(its a famous game and this was a personal project, I had to practice grid and I wanted to make something interactive where I could learn as many features as I could)

- Implemented using simple JS DOM manipulation please refer to my script.js file
- CSS involved uses keyframes to simulate animations for the home menu
- HTML is kept very basic for efficiency
- Added features like difficulty selection and spam protection to maintain the integrity
- Also added delays wherever required for better UX
